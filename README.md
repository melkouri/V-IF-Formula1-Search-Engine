# V'IF Formula 1 Search Engine

In this project, we propose a small search engine specialized in a well-defined and restricted field. 
Therefore, we have chosen the subject of Formula 1. Using the semantic web, we have been able to design a search engine centered on the vocabulary of Formula 1: drivers, teams, Grand Prix races and annual Grand Prix races, etc.

To launch the application, open 'index.html' in a browser.
