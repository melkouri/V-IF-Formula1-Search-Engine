# V'IF Formula 1 Search Engine

In this project, we propose a small search engine specialized in a well-defined and restricted field using Semantic Web. 
Therefore, we have chosen the subject of Formula 1. Using the semantic web, we have been able to design a search engine centered on the vocabulary of Formula 1: drivers, teams, Grand Prix races and annual Grand Prix races, etc.

In order to obtain the available RDF data on the Internet, we made requests to Dbpedia using a technology from the Semantic Web: the SPARQL language.
Thus, we send these requests through AJAX requests that allow us to send HTTP requests directly from our JavaScript code.
For vanilla JavaScript, the returned information is displayed as a Web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies.

To launch the application, open 'index.html' in a browser.
